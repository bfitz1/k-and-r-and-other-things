# K & R & Other Things

Never actually went through this book, and it's a convenient enough excuse
to brush up on C.

## Goals
Roughly in order of likelihood:

- [ ] Read the entire book
- [ ] Complete most of the exercises
- [ ] Rewrite exercise attempts in a more comfortable style (i.e. C99 or newer with fewer annoying C-isms)
- [ ] Explore the idea of run.sh scripts as an entry point for projects
- [ ] Explore unit testing C code, either using a C framework or using Zig
